# Data Plane Gateway

[Gazette](https://github.com/gazette/core) exposes several GRPC services we'd like to provide broader access to.
1. We'd like to expose REST versions of these services.
2. We'd like to enforce authentication and authorization.

### REST Gateway

We use the [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/) project to generate REST handlers from the protobuf definitions found in Gazette. We also generate Swagger documentation which we then use to generate a TypeScript client. The REST gateway forwards requests to the Auth Gateway.

### Auth Gateway

The GRPC side of the Gateway proxies requests to our main Gazette cluster. First we check for an authentication token issued by the Control Plane. This token provides us with a set of authorized prefixes. We authorize requests by checking the provided label selectors on a request against these authorized prefixes. Once authorized, requests are sent along to Gazette proper.

## Usage

To build the Gateway:

```console
go build .
# or
go install .
```

To run the Gateway:

```console
data-plane-gateway
```

This launches the Gateway on port 28318. This port will serve both the REST and GRPC traffic. Use `data-plane-gateway --help` for more options.

## Development

The Gateway extensively uses code generation tools. This generated code is checked into the repo, so most users don't need to worry about them.

* To Install code generation tools, you'll need a few prerequisites which you can install with `make protobuf_tools`.
* To run the code generation, run `make`.
* To hack on the Gateway, use `go run .`.
* To hack on the typescript client, launch a Data Plane and Gateway with `./test.sh server`.
* To run all the tests, run `./test.sh run`.

#### Components

* `{broker,consumer}_service.yaml` define which RPCs are exposed as REST handlers.
* `gen/` houses all the files generated by `grpc-gateway`.
* `rest.go` wires up the generated REST handler code into a single server.
* `journal_server.go` enforces auth on top of the Gazette JournalServer interface.
* `shard_server.go` enforces auth on top of the Gazette ShardServer interface.
* `main.go` multiplexes the REST server and the GRPC server.
* `auth.go` decodes authentication tokens from the Control Plane and enforces our authorization rules.
* `client/src` defines a TypeScript library that can interact with the REST api.
* `client/dist` contains the generated JavaScript package.
* `build.sh` wrangles all the configuration options for building the gateway.
* `test.sh` launches a local Flow data plane, the gateway, and runs the client tests against it.
